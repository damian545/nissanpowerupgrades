      <h1>Coil packs, ignition system and Tuning:</h1>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p>In this part, it is crutial to have the Tuning right. So the coil packs and igniter need to be upgraded to suit the power 
          you desire for a CA18DET (R32 GTR coil packs, injectors and resistor. It bolts straight in, funny that..), SR20DET plenty of 
          kit available ranging from R35 coil packs, audi R8 coil packs and from split fire. Same for R32 GTST, R33 GTST and R34 gtst.
          As for the tuning side of things, a good computer to run everything. Only if you want larger injectors, a fuel-air only 
          computer will be fine. Don't go overboard with injector size, I read somewhere it was 1cc to 1hp ratio. My R33 was making
          242 kw at the wheels with stock injectors.. More power, comes more air. So the air flow meter need to be high volume, so a 
          Z32 AFM will be needed. It can be wired into any Nissan, no dramas there. Lots of boost will require you to change the suction
          pipe from rubber to metal,( I had one custom made) if you don't change it. It will suck closed when boost comes on, not ideal.
          There are a few aftermarket companys out there that make them now, RHD.JAPAN.COM do them. I personally would take your rubber 
          unit to an exhaust shop or a fabricator and see if they can make one up for you. Depends on if the turbo is stock size or a 
          larger item? Only upgrade the exhaust manifold if you need to, the stock one flows well enough. Nistune do a variety of flash 
          tuning for your car, I had a flash tune and it was fine. Be sure that you are done with the mods, if you do injectors later on.
          You will need another flash tune, if you use an aftermarket computer it will just need to be tuned slightly to suit. Stock clutch
          will need to be upgraded, something like a 5 puck type. Just tell the mechanic or clutch expert what sort of power your car
          generates and they should have something for you.
