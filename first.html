      </div>
      <p>Because I don't know what you personally want to modify and what type of budget you have, I will just mention everything
          to modify and why.        
      </p>
      <h1>Exhaust System:</h1>
      <p>This is probably the first thing that is changed on a turbo Nissan and the most misunderstood as well..
          Everybody will say "3 inch exhaust is the way to go!!" This is false in a big way, the turbo exhaust should 
          be a vortex system ie small diameter to large diameter. The exhaust from the turbo should be 2 inch until the catalytic
          converter, from there it should be 3 inch to the diff and 3.5 inch afterwards. My exhaust was just that and my turbo
          was a Trust TD-06 20G turbine, the diameter of the exhaust housing was 2 inch. So realistically, measure the turbo exhaust housing
          and that is the diameter you need. So if it is 1.3 inch, so is the exhaust and if it is 4 inch, so is the exhaust.
          Just make sure it gets bigger after the catalytic converter. Stock turbo or stock sized upgraded turbo, use the factory
          dump pipe and front pipe until the catalytic converter and then an inch larger to the diff to half an inch larger again to 
          the muffler. If you have a full length 3 inch exhaust from turbo, it will be loud and it will lose power because of it.
          I changed my turbo because of another reason and I will tell you why later on, but the exhaust was the same. I used my 
          factory dump pipe and front pipe, the rest was the same when I was using the TD06 turbo.
