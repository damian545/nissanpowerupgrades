      <p>There are some many coil overs to choose from now, the hardest thing is choosing the one that is right for you. All I can say is 
          adjustability, adjustability. The more you can dial in what you want, the better here. Damper adjust, height adjust, rebound adjust 
          and camber adjust (not for Skylines, camber arms are required).There are lots of other products for handling, buy what you need for
          your project. Swaybars, thicker the better. I had 27 mm Whiteline front and back non blade adjustable type.           
          For s13, use R32 gtr rear only. You are probably better off just getting new ones and you get new rubbers too.
          Add 2 degrees of camber, to give your car a little agressive stance and to help you fit another inch wider wheels under the guards..
          Get rid of the HiCas, terrible invention!! Remove and replace the rear diff cradle bushings for alloy ones, this will stop any movement.
          Even if you don't drift the car, way more feel of what is happening at the back during high speed (On the race track people..). The diff, go 
          2way or 1.5way, depends on what your vision is for your car. The thing that is most important (It was for me..), is the ratio.
          Most auto diffs from Nissan are 4.363 ratio, I went from 4.111 to 4.363 and what a difference that made.. When I changed my turbo,
          I changed my diff too, I thought my turbo was too big. I thought I had "Turbo Lag!!", no.. Wrong diff in short.. I changed my turbo 
          to a GTX 28/63, on 7 psi it made 198 kw at the wheels before tune. After it made 223 kw at the wheels, the TD-06 started to make 
          power at 3800 RPM with "4.111" diff ratio mind you. Now the power comes on at 1500 RPM and kicks out nearly soon after, what a difference.
          So having the right ratio in the diff really helps what you want your car to do, as for everything else for that matter.
